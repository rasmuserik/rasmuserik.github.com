# Initial abstract

    Programming practices such as: continuous integration with travis-ci,
    scripting and server-side code with node.js, modules and packaging
    (commonjs, npm, ...), cross-platform mobile apps with PhoneGap, and
    the what's and why's on the language and virtual machines. Code and
    slides for the talk will be online on http://solsort.dk/.
